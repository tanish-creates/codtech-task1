Simple Calculator
Overview
The Simple Calculator is a Python-based command-line tool designed to perform basic arithmetic operations. It provides a user-friendly interface where users can input two numbers and select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). The program then performs the chosen operation and displays the result.

This project is ideal for beginners learning Python as it covers key programming concepts such as:

User input
Conditional statements
Error handling for invalid inputs and division by zero
Features
Addition (+): Computes the sum of two numbers.
Subtraction (-): Computes the difference between two numbers.
Multiplication (*): Computes the product of two numbers.
Division (/): Computes the quotient of two numbers (with division-by-zero protection).

How It Works
Users are prompted to input two numbers.
Users select an operation by entering its corresponding symbol.
The program validates the inputs and performs the operation.
The result is displayed, or an error message is shown for invalid inputs or operations.
This project can be extended further by adding more operations, a graphical user interface, or advanced mathematical functions.
